Build a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

Explanation:

Criteria Checks: The tool checks if the password meets each of the following criteria:
Length (at least 8 characters)
Contains uppercase letters
Contains lowercase letters
Contains numbers
Contains special characters.

Strength Score: Each criterion met adds one point to the strength score, giving a maximum score of 5.

Feedback: Based on the score, the tool provides feedback on the passwordâ€™s strength and suggests improvements.

This tool gives users a clear indication of their password strength and actionable tips for improvement.
